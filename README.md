# Agora Citizen Network

Monorepo for [Agora Citizen Network](https://agoracitizen.network).

## About

We are at a critical moment where social media platforms are increasingly evolving into tools of computational propaganda (the use of bots and algorithms to manipulate public opinion), polarizing society, and threatening democratic values worldwide. Recent advancements in AI have unfortunately accelerated this dangerous trend.

**Agora Citizen Network** was born out of our belief that digital public spaces must be intentionally designed to strengthen the social fabric of our societies. We envision a future where technology transforms social diversity into a catalyst for progress, rather than a driver of division.

### What we're doing differently

- Using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography, Agora allows users to anonymously prove they are human - not bots - without disclosing any personal information to anyone, including us.
- Besides, most social networks today use engagement-based ranking algorithms designed to maximize user attention and engagement. Unfortunately, these algorithms often promote polarizing content, which tends to attract the most attention, whether good or bad. In contrast, Agora employs bridging-based ranking algorithms that aim to highlight content appreciated by users across different political viewpoints. The goal is not to censor extreme opinions but to preserve a rich diversity of viewpoints and identify common ground.
- Additionally, we're developing [Racine](https://github.com/zkorum/racine), a metaprotocol built on [UCAN](https://github.com/ucan-wg) and [Rarimo](https://github.com/rarimo), designed to give users full control over their digital identities and data. We believe that while protocols may not be inherently interoperable, verifiable data is. By putting humans at the center, Racine enables users to decide what data to share, with which service providers, and where to store it, ensuring both self-sovereignty and verifiable data provenance.

### Roadmap

- Q1 2025: [Agora MVP](https://agoracitizen.network/feed/) is live and actively seeking your feedback - [Get in touch!](https://linktr.ee/yutingzkorum)
- Q2 2025: Evolving from MVP to SLCP (Simple, Lovable, Complete Product)
- Q3 & Q4 2025: Develop pilot projects with institutions, NGOs, market research firms, media outlets, and other partners looking to engage their audiences through Agora.

## Development

### Prerequisites

Install:

- rsync
- make
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
- sed
- bash
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Services

### Agora

A Quasar application (frontend)

### Api

A Fastify application supported by a PostgreSQL database (backend).

### Python bridge

A Flask application to enable the Node backend to communicate with the data science libraries written in Python ([reddwarf](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf) especially).

### OpenAPI

We generate an `openapi-zkorum.json` file from the backend, and then use [openapi-generator-cli](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to generate the corresponding front.

### Getting started
Please read README's in `/agora`, `/api`, and `/python-bridge`

### Run in dev mode

Frontend App:

```
make dev-app
```

Backend API:

```
make dev-api
```

Python Bridge:

```
make dev-polis
```

### Shared

Some typescript source files are shared directly without using npm packages - by copy-pasting using rsync.

Use these commands to automatically rsync shared files to back and front:

```
make dev-sync
```

### OpenAPI  

Automatically generate frontend stub from backends and subsequent openapi changes:

```
make dev-generate
```


... and start coding!
