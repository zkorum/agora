          >ZKorum SAS</a
        >. At ZKorum, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right. Our
        mission is to empower users to engage in political and social discourse
        while maintaining control over their identity and personal information.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how and why Agora Citizen Network ("Agora",
        "we", "us" or "ZKorum") collects, uses, and shares information about you
        when you use our website and mobile applications (collectively, the
        "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us. We are responsible
        for the collection and use of your personal data in the manner explained
        in this privacy policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have any questions about this, please contact us by e-mail:
        <a href="mailto:legal@zkorum.com">legal@zkorum.com</a>. If you are a
        California resident, we would like to draw your attention to Article 7.

      <section>
        <h2>Agora is a public platform</h2>
        <p>
          Most content on Agora is publicly accessible, meaning your profile,
          posts, votes and opinions can be viewed by anyone, even without an
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are not required to create an account to browse Agora. However, to
          participate in discussions and interact with content, you may need to
          register using one of the following methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Log-in via phone number (verified through a one-time code)</li>
          <li>
            Log-in via cryptographic proof from a third-party verification app
            (<a
              href="https://rarime.com/privacy-notice.html"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >RariMe</a
            >), which verifies your identity using a passport-based
            Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). This method ensures that your identity
            is validated while maintaining privacy. Agora does not have access
            to your passport details, only the cryptographic proof confirming
            uniqueness and eligibility.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your Agora account will have a username, which can be manually
          selected or automatically generated. Usernames are public but do not
          need to be linked to your real identity. You may also provide optional
          profile details such as preferred topics, which can be modified or
          removed at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most content on Agora Citizen Network is public. When you submit
          content (e.g. a post, opinion or reaction), it is visible to all users
          and may be indexed by search engines. Agora also utilizes
          cryptographic proofs to provide data verifiability, which means
          certain interactions (such as account creation and participation) are
          publicly recorded in a decentralized manner.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Agora profile</h3>
        <p>
          Your Agora profile is public by default and contains information such
          as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Username</li>
          <li>Unique User Identifier (UUID)</li>
          <li>
            Activity history (posts, opinions, interactions (emojis,
            agree/disagree actions, claps, upvotes/downvotes), poll responses
            and flagged/reported content
          </li>
          <li>Communities and topics of interest</li>
          <li>
            Verification status:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Verified via passport proof (user nullifier & bidirectional
                identity proofs)
              </li>
              <li>
                Verified via phone number (Agora-signed proof binding did:keys
                to user UUID)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Users have the option to post anonymously. When using this feature,
          usernames and profile pictures are replaced with generic identifiers,
          and content is not linked publicly to the user's profile.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-party services</h3>
        <p>
          Agora uses third-party services that may process IP addresses and
          other personal data. Where possible, Agora configures services to use
          EU regional endpoints or uses EU-based providers. These services have
          their own privacy policies, and users are encouraged to review them.

        <h2>3. With whom do we share your personal data?</h2>
        <p>
          3.1. In principle, we do not share your personal data with anyone
          other than the persons who work for us, as well as with the suppliers
          who help us process your personal data. Anyone who has access to your
          personal data will always be bound by strict legal or contractual
          obligations to keep your personal data safe and confidential. This
          means that only the following categories of recipients will receive
          your personal data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You;</li>
          <li>Our employees and suppliers; and</li>
          <li>
            Government or judicial authorities to the extent that we are obliged
            to share your personal data with them (e.g. tax authorities, police
            or judicial authorities).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          3.2. We send your personal data outside the European Economic Area
          (EEA) (the European Economic Area consists of the EU, Liechtenstein,
          Norway and Iceland). We will transfer this personal data outside the
          EEA to communicate with the categories of recipients of your personal
          data as defined in this Article 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.3. We will apply appropriate safeguards to protect your personal
          data during transfers, such as working only with processors located in
          countries that have an European Commission adequacy decision or are
          certified under an approved framework like the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
          Framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4. If there is no European Commission adequacy decision for the
          destination country, we will use appropriate safeguards, as described
          in Article 46 of the GDPR, when transferring personal data, and such
          transfers and technical and organisational security measures will be
          documented in accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR. For example, we
          use standard contractual clauses to protect the transfer of personal
          data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), thus
          insuring that an equivalent level of data protection applies to your
          personal data even if EU data protection law is not directly
          applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5. Agora may transfer anonymized and/or aggregated data to
          organizations outside the jurisdiction in which you provide it. Should
          such transfer take place, Agora will ensure that there are safeguards
          in place to ensure the safety and integrity of your data and all
          rights with respect to your personal data you might enjoy under
          applicable mandatory law.

      <section>
        <h2>4. How long do we keep your personal data?</h2>
        <p>
          4.1. Your personal data will only be processed for as long as
          necessary to achieve the purposes described above or, when we have
          asked you for your consent, until you withdraw your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2. As a general rule, we will de-identify your personal data when it
          is no longer needed for the purposes described above. However, we
          cannot delete your personal data if there is a legal or regulatory
          obligation or a court or administrative order preventing us from doing
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3. We retain all personal data collected through our website or
          mobile app, for as long as necessary to protect the legitimate
          interests stated in Article 2 or until your consent is withdrawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.4. All personal data we collect through our interactions with you
          through social media, telephone, email or other digital communication
          channels will be retained for as long as necessary to communicate with
          you, but also to maintain a historical record of our communications.
          This allows us to return to previous communications when you come back
          to us with new questions, requests, comments or other input.

        <h2>5. How do we keep your personal data secure?</h2>
        <p>
          5.1. At Agora, safeguarding your personal data is a top priority. We
          have implemented a range of technical and organizational measures to
          ensure that all personal data processed remains secure. These measures
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data minimization and privacy by design:</strong> We only
            collect the minimum personal data necessary for platform
            functionality, avoiding the storage of sensitive information
            whenever possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Encryption and pseudonymization:</strong> Personal data is
            encrypted, and pseudonymization techniques are applied to protect
            user identities. For example, phone numbers are never stored in
            plaintext; instead, we apply a cryptographic "pepper" and hash them
            to prevent unauthorized access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Zero-knowledge proof authentication:</strong> Agora
            leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) for passport verification,
            ensuring that users can prove their eligibility without revealing
            sensitive personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decentralized cryptographic proofs:</strong> Certain user
            interactions (such as account creation and participation) are
            publicly verifiable through cryptographic proofs without revealing
            user identities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure authentication:</strong> We do not store passwords.
            Instead, authentication is handled through one-time verification
            codes or cryptographic keys, reducing the risk of credential leaks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure protection:</strong> Our platform is secured
            against cyber threats using DDoS protection, access controls, and
            network monitoring to detect and mitigate attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transparency and user control:</strong> Users have the
            ability to manage their personal data, delete their account and
            control how their information is processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Regular security evaluations:</strong> Our security measures
            are periodically reviewed and updated to address emerging threats
            and improve data protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Controlled access to logs and analytics:</strong> Only
            aggregated and anonymized analytics data is used for performance
            monitoring and improving user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data redundancy and backups:</strong> Data is securely
            stored on AWS servers in Dublin, Ireland and replicated in Paris,
            France for disaster recovery purposes, with strict access controls
            and encryption measures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limited metadata collection:</strong> IP addresses are not
            actively logged or stored by Agora, except as required by Cloudflare
            and cloud service providers for DDoS protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anonymized AI translation:</strong> Content sent to Google
            Cloud Platform for translation is transmitted as-is without any
            accompanying metadata (user identifiers, etc.) and processed in EU
            region.
          </li>

              for anonymized crash reports:</strong
            >
            Agora utilizes Sentry (hosted on EU servers) for error tracking and
            crash reporting purposes. Session Replay is enabled with full text
            masking and media blocking to prevent capture of user input or
            visual content. Application state data (Vue Pinia stores) is
            automatically transformed to redact all personal information
            (including phone numbers, usernames, draft content, followed topics,
            and user-generated content) before transmission to Sentry, ensuring
            that logs remain anonymized and do not contain personal data. Sentry
            does not use tracking cookies.

        <h2>6. Your rights regarding your personal data</h2>
        <p>
          6.1. When we collect and use your personal data, you will enjoy a
          number of rights that you can exercise in the manner described below.
          Please note that when you wish to exercise a right, we will ask you
          for proof of identity. We do this to prevent a personal data breach
          (e.g. because an unauthorized person is impersonating you and is
          exercising a right in your name).
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2. Depending on the processing and the legal basis, as a data
          subject you have a number of possibilities to keep control over your
          personal data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>right to access your data</li>
          <li>right to amend your data</li>
          <li>right to object to the processing of your personal data</li>
          <li>right to restrict data processing</li>
          <li>right to have your data erased</li>
          <li>right to withdraw your previously given consent</li>
          <li>right to transfer your data</li>
          <li>
            right to lodge complaints with the competent data protection
            authority.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          6.3. We should point out to you that these rights are not always
          absolute, that in certain circumstances we are entitled or even
          required by law to further process your personal data and that we may
          therefore not always be able to comply (fully) with your request. In
          such cases, we will inform you accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.4. You may exercise these rights free of charge, except in cases of
          abuse and in which case we are entitled to charge an administration
          fee to comply with your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.5. Note that you can delete your own reactions, claps,
          upvote/downvote, poll responses, agree/disagree actions,
          conversations, opinions, replies, "views" information and the language
          spoken (at least one must remain).
        </p>

        <h3>
          6.6. To delete the passport proof (if a phone number has already been
          entered) but keep your account:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Generate a new proof with RariMe:</strong> You'll need to
            create a fresh verification proof, but this time it will contain
            only your nullifier and not your nationality or sex.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm the deletion:</strong> Once confirmed, your previous
            passport proof, including nationality and sex, will be permanently
            deleted.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Some cryptographic records will still be kept, even if you delete your
          account, to ensure accountability:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) used for deletion, which contains
            only the nullifier and cryptographic data (not nationality or sex).
          </li>
          <li>
            The User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) proof that signs
            this ZKP, verifying the request from your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            The UCAN proof confirming the deletion request, ensuring that the
            request was processed correctly.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These cryptographic records exist to prove to third-party auditors
          that Agora did not censor accounts or data but rather deleted the
          information only upon user request. This ensures transparency and
          trust in the system.
        </p>

        <h3>6.7. How to delete your account:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you verified your account using RariMe (passport verification),
            you must generate a new proof containing only the nullifier
            (excluding nationality and sex) before proceeding with deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you verified your account using only a phone number, you must
            re-verify your phone number to confirm and complete the account
            deletion. Your account will be deleted in 15 days.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          6.8. If you have a complaint about the processing of your personal
          data by us, you can always contact us at
          <a href="mailto:legal@zkorum.com">legal@zkorum.com</a>. If you are not
          satisfied with our response, you may lodge a complaint with the

        <h2>7. Important information for California residents</h2>
        <p>
          7.1. Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("the
          CCPA"), we provide the following additional details to California
          residents. During the preceding 12 months, we have collected, used,
          and shared the categories of your personal information described above
          in this privacy policy for our operational business purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.2. We have not sold your personal information, meaning that we have
          not disclosed your personal information for monetary or other valuable
          consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.3. You have the right to request access or deletion of your personal
          information and to request transparency about our privacy practices.
          If you would like to exercise your rights under the CCPA, please see
          Article 6. Once we receive your request, we will verify it by
          requesting information to confirm your identity, including by asking
          you for additional information. If you would like to use an agent
          registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your
          rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with
          power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written
          authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.4. If you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you
          different prices or provide different quality of services for
          exercising your rights unless those differences are permitted by law.
