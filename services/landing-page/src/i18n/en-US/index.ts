  coreInnovationPart1: 'We have developed a <a href="https://github.com/zkorum/poc/blob/main/vc-flow/README.md" target="_blank">Verifiable and Privacy-Preserving Posting Protocol</a>, based on Verifiable Credentials and Zero Knowledge (ZK) proofs, that allows users to have granular control over their identities and data on social media. This solution not only is resistant to bots or fake accounts but also maximizes user privacy.',
  coreInnovationPart2: 'For example, if someone posts as an anonymous French citizen, we can cryptographically prove that this post indeed comes from a unique user with a French ID, although we do not know who this person is. The origin of each post is encrypted on the client side (userâ€™s device) preventing anyone from linking posts to authors.',
