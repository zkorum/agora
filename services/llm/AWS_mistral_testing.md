# Testing Mistral-Small
We tested model responses to different prompts and inference parameter combinations (on AWS Bedrock) to determine the configuration best-suited to our use-case. We focused on sufficiently general, neutral cluster labels that adhered to the maximum word count, in addition to robust summaries. Prompt Version 4 is the prompt currently in use, with temperature = 0.4, top_p = 0.8, top_k = 70.

## Prompt Version 1
#### System instructions:
You are an expert analyst summarizing survey results. Given a JSON input containing structured data about a group conversation, generate a concise output in JSON format that strictly adheres to the following JSON Schema:
```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["summary", "clusters"],
  "properties": {
	"summary": {
  	"type": "string",
  	"maxLength": 300,
  	"description": "Overall conversation summary (max 300 characters)"
	},
	"clusters": {
  	"type": "object",
  	"additionalProperties": {
    	"type": "object",
    	"required": ["label", "summary"],
    	"properties": {
      	"label": {
        	"type": "string",
        	"pattern": "^\\S+(?:\\s\\S+)?$",
        	"maxLength": 60,
        	"description": "Cluster label (exactly 1 or 2 words, neutral noun describing people/groups, max 60 characters)"
      	},
      	"summary": {
        	"type": "string",
        	"maxLength": 300,
        	"description": "Cluster summary (max 300 characters)"
      	}
    	}
  	}
	}
  }
}
```

Key Constraints:
1. Summary:
   - Maximum 300 characters.
   - Capture key insights, majority opinions, and controversial points objectively.

2. Cluster Labels:
   - Exactly 1 or 2 words (no exceptions).
   - Neutral descriptors of people/groups (e.g., "Skeptics" not "Luddites", "Researchers" not "Visionaries").
   - Never use value-laden terms (e.g., "Pioneers" is biased towards a specific cluster).
   - Never use abstract concepts (e.g., "Concerns", “Collaborative” is invalid).
   - Noun form only (no verbs/adjectives).
   - Total length must be less than 60 characters.
   - Rephrase multi-word concepts into 1 or 2-word labels (e.g., "Hybrid Advocates" instead of "Hybrid Work Supporters").

3. Cluster Summaries:
   - Maximum 300 characters.
   - Focus on group perspectives and disagreements.
   - Maintain neutral tone, focusing on factual perspectives.

Example Valid Output:
```
{
  "summary": "Discussion highlights remote work's impact on productivity, work-life balance, and office culture, with debates over collaboration effectiveness.",
  "clusters": {
	"0": {
  	"label": "Office Advocates",
  	"summary": "Emphasize the importance of in-person collaboration and traditional office culture for productivity and team cohesion."
	},
	"1": {
  	"label": "Remote Enthusiasts",
  	"summary": "Highlight increased productivity and improved work-life balance as key benefits of remote work arrangements."
	}
  }
}
```

Example Invalid Output:
```
{
  "clusters": {
	"0": {
  	"label": "Traditional Work Supporters", // INVALID: Exceeds 2 words
  	"summary": "Prefer in-office work for better collaboration." // Valid
	},
	"1": {
  	"label": "Work Flexibility", // INVALID: Abstract concept, not people
  	"summary": "Advocate for remote work options and flexible schedules." // Valid
	}
  }
}
```

STRICT RULES:
1. Count words strictly. Labels must be 1 or 2 words maximum, with a maximum length of 60 characters. (e.g. "Hybrid Work Supporters" (3 words) is invalid. Use "Hybrid Advocates" (2 words)).
2. Labels/summaries exceeding word and character count limits will cause validation errors.
3. Labels must describe people/groups, not concepts (e.g. "Defenders", not "Defense").
4. Use agentive nouns, such as those ending with -ists, -ers, -ors, or -ians (e.g. Ethicists, etc.)
5. Labels must be value-neutral (e.g., "Supporters" not "Champions", "Critics" not "Naysayers").
6. Avoid terms implying superiority/inferiority of any cluster (e.g., "Elites")
7. Use descriptive occupational/positional terms when possible (e.g., "Economists", "Ethicists").
8. Validation errors will occur for biased or non-neutral labels.
9. If unable to create a meaningful label in 2 words, prioritize brevity over detail (e.g. "Traditionalists" instead of "Culture Defenders").

Now analyze the following JSON input carefully and provide insightful, concise labels and summaries that capture the core of the discussion while strictly adhering to above rules.

##### Testing a higher temperature (0.7)
| Temperature | Top P | Top K | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.7 | 0.65 | 65 | Based on the provided JSON input, here's the concise JSON output summarizing the survey results:```json { "summary": "Discussion on implementing a four-day work week in Japan reveals strong support for improved mental health and work-life balance, with concerns about labor shortages and productivity in an aging workforce.", "clusters": { "0": { "label": "Tourism Supporters", "summary": "Advocate for mandatory three-day weekends to boost domestic tourism and regional economies." }, "1": { "label": "Flexibility Advocates", "summary": "Support flexible implementation to accommodate different industries and operational needs, but express concern about potential age-related productivity disparities." }, "2": { "label": "Government Trialists", "summary": "Propose trialing four-day weeks in government sectors before private implementation." } } } ``` |
| 0.7 | 0.65 | 65 | Based on the provided JSON input, here's the concise JSON output summarizing the survey results:```json { "summary": "The conversation revolves around the implementation of a mandatory carbon tax in Germany, with majority support for equal application to corporations and consumers, and use of revenue for renewable energy infrastructure.

The summary captures the key insights objectively and maintains a neutral tone. 2. The cluster labels are exactly 1 or 2 words, use neutral nouns describing people/groups, avoid value-laden or abstract terms, avoid abstract concepts, and use agentive nouns. 3. The cluster summaries capture the group perspectives and disagreements within the maximum 300 characters limit. |
| 0.7 | 0.65 | 65 |  Based on the provided JSON input, here's the concise JSON output: ```json { "summary": "Discussion focuses on affordable housing mandates in Vancouver, with majority support for allocating 30% of new units below market rate and retroactive rent control policies.

It seemed like a temperature of 0.7 was too high, because there were a lot of inconsistencies across the different answers for different JSON inputs. I then tried a lower temperature: 0.6:

| Temperature | Top P | Top K | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.6 | 0.65 | 65 | { "\$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#", "type": "object", "required": ["summary", "clusters"], "properties": { "summary": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 300, "description": "Overall conversation summary (max 300 characters)" }, "clusters": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": { "type": "object", "required": ["label", "summary"], "properties": { "label": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^\\S+(?:\\s\\S+)?$", "maxLength": 60, "description": "Cluster label (exactly 1 or 2 words, neutral noun describing people/groups, max 60 characters)" }, "summary": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 300, "description": "Cluster summary (max 300 characters)" } } } } }, "summary": "The conversation revolves around the implementation of a mandatory carbon tax in Germany, with strong support for equal application to corporations and individuals, and funding renewable energy infrastructure.

| 0.6 | 0.65 | 65 | Based on the provided JSON input, here's the concise JSON output: ```json { "summary": "Discussion revolves around school funding formula reform in Australia, with majority support for increased funding for students with disabilities and remote indigenous schools. Controversy arises over private school funding and teacher salary increases.", "clusters": { "0": { "label": "Performance Metric Advocates", "summary": "Support tying teacher salary increases to student performance metrics and oppose self-funding of elite sports programs." }, "1": { "label": "Disadvantage Index Supporters", "summary": "Advocate for socioeconomic disadvantage index to determine the majority of funding allocations and disagree with private schools losing government funding." } } } ``` |
| 0.6 | 0.65 | 65 | Based on the provided JSON input, here is the concise JSON output: ```json { "summary": "Participants discuss metro system expansion in Lagos, Nigeria, with strong support for east-west corridors, night services, and transit-oriented development.

| 0.6 | 0.65 | 65 | Based on the provided JSON input, here's the concise JSON output: ```json { "summary": "Participants discuss AI governance in Brazil, with a majority agreeing on the need for bias audits and different oversight for open-source and commercial AI models. Controversy arises over military AI exemptions and facial recognition use.", "clusters": { "0": { "label": "Government Regulators", "summary": "Advocate for parliamentary approval of public sector AI deployments and support for safety-focused AI startups." }, "1": { "label": "Private Sector Advocates", "summary": "Support tax incentives for safety-focused AI startups, but disagree on the legality of facial recognition for private security use." } } } ``` |

At this point,  it looked like the generated labels were oddly too specific and not sufficiently summarizing/generalizing the cluster. So I decided to (1) lower the temperature to generate more consistent label formats (2) edit the prompt to add more explicit instructions for label generation (+ telling it not to include "here's your output")

Do not print this skeleton format in your output.


II. Cluster Labels Rules

1.  Length and Format:
-   Must be exactly 1 or 2 words.
-   Use neutral agentive nouns ending in -ists, -ers, -ians, etc.
-   Avoid policy-specific terms or geographic references.
-   Avoid abstract concepts (e.g. avoid “Concerns”)
    
2.  Content Abstraction:
-   Focus on group positions, intellectual traditions, or philosophical approaches.
- Avoid describing specific mechanisms (e.g., "Income Threshold Supporters" or “Rural Educators”).
    
3.  Tone:
-   Aim for a professional/academic tone that reflects generality and positionality.
-   Use terms that could apply across contexts (e.g., "Pragmatists", "Skeptics").
    
4.  Examples:
-   Good: "Redistributionists", "Decentralists", "Humanists", "Skeptics", “Tech Optimists”.
-   Bad: "Regional Advocates", “AI Tool Users", "Naysayers".
    
5.  Generation Process:  
    a) Identify the core stance or intellectual tradition within the cluster.  
    b) Abstract this stance into a general term using agentive suffixes.  
    c) Validate that the label avoids policy specifics and geographic references.
    d) Validate that the label is either 1 or 2 words.

III. Summaries:
- Maximum 300 characters
- Capture key insights objectively
- Focus on group perspectives and disagreements
- Maintain a neutral tone

IV. Strictly adhere to the input data. Do not invent new clusters or information.  

V. The output JSON must contain only the JSON structure as defined, with no additional text or preface

The labels are still occasionally bit length and overly specific (e.g. "AI Art Pragmatists", "Medical Benefit Advocates"). At this point, I decided to edit the prompt to include more examples and push for more abstraction/generalization in labels.

      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 300,
      "description": "Overall conversation summary (max 300 characters)"
    },
    "clusters": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": {
        "type": "object",

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Do not print this skeleton format in your output.

II. Cluster Labels Rules

1. Length and Format:
- Must be exactly 1 or 2 words.
- Use neutral agentive nouns ending in -ists, -ers, -ians, etc.
- Avoid policy-specific terms or geographic references.
- Avoid abstract concepts (e.g. avoid “Concerns”)

2. Content Abstraction:
- Focus on group positions, intellectual traditions, or philosophical approaches.
- Overt discussion-specific context may be omitted if the context is implied by opposing clusters. (e.g. use labels like “Skeptics”, “Technologists”, and “Ethicists” instead of "AI Skeptics", "AI Tool Advocates", "AI Ethicists")
- Avoid describing specific mechanisms (e.g., avoid "Income Threshold Supporters" or “Rural Educators”).

3. Tone:
- Aim for a professional/academic tone that reflects generality and positionality.
- Use terms that could apply across contexts (e.g., "Pragmatists", "Skeptics").

4. Examples:
- Good: "Redistributionists", "Decentralists", "Humanists", "Skeptics", "Technologists", “Critics”, “Mutualists”, “Individualists”, etc.
- Bad: "Regional Advocates", "AI Tool Users", "Naysayers", “Plastic Ban Advocates”, etc.

5. Generation Process:
  a) Identify the core stance or intellectual tradition within the cluster.
  b) Abstract this stance into a general term using agentive suffixes.
  c) Validate that the label avoids policy specifics and geographic references.
  d) Validate that the label is either 1 or 2 words.

III. Summaries:
- Maximum 300 characters
- Capture key insights objectively
- Focus on group perspectives and disagreements
- Maintain a neutral tone

IV. Strictly adhere to the input data. Do not invent new clusters or information.
